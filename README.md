# PlowSharePython
## Introduction
This is a set of files implemetned to be used with Node.js, in order to execute plowdown (a plowshare executable subset) to download specific file from a given URL as the first argument through python3-based executable. They, of course, read the **conf** file for each individual username, and password for each specific website.

*These commands are intended to be used on Raspberry Pi, even though they may work on other OSes.*
